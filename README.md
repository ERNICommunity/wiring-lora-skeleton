# wiring-lora-skeleton
Wiring / Arduino based Skeleton Embedded Application, powered by [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org "Cross-platform build system")

This project is created for an [Adafruit Feather M0 w/ RFM95 LoRa Radio - 868/915MHz](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-radio-with-lora-radio-module) controller module.

## Purpose
This project builds up an Arduino Framework based application skeleton and it comprises of several components helping with debugging and integrating embedded applications on [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) based contoller modules.

It is designed and tested on an Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa RFM95 Microcontroller Unit. It could be made running on an Arduino Mega 2560 with the Dragino LoRa Shield.

This skeleton application can help you to build up your own Arduino Framework based LoRaWan applications. 

This project integrates the following **components**:

* [***SpinTimer***](https://github.com/dniklaus/spin-timer): configurable recurring or non-recurring timer to schedule events without having to use Arduino delay() function; helps to improve your application's architecture by encapsulating the timers into your components and thus make them active
* [***Debug-Cli***](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/debug-cli): interactive console environment with command tree that can be built up decentralized (from any different location in your application code and within any component)
* [***Dbg-Trace***](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/dbg-trace): debug trace log environment with configurable log levels
* [***Ramutils***](https://github.com/dniklaus/arduino-utils-mem): helps to determine the free Ram that is currently available
* [***App-Dbg***](https://github.com/dniklaus/wiring-app-debug): boilerplate code setting up all the debug environment such as CLI and Tracing and free RAM info printer
* [***Battery***](https://github.com/dniklaus/Battery): LiPo Battery Voltage Surveillance component
* [***LMIC***](https://github.com/mymichu/Arduino_LMIC.git#EuropeConfiguration): IBM LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C) library, slightly modified to run in the Arduino environment
* [***lorawan-lmic-wrapper***](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/lorawan-lmic-wrapper.git): LoRaWan: LMIC library wrapper (Arduino Framework based)
* [***lorawan-assets***](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/lorawan-assets.git): LoRaWan Assets (storage for App & Network Session Keys, Device Id)
* [***arduino-toggle-button***](https://github.com/dniklaus/arduino-toggle-button.git): A virtual binary status implementation

This skeleton application demonstrates how to integrate libraries provided by the PlatformIO ecosystem and also how to use your own libraries and can help you to build up your own Arduino Framework based applications with focus on LoRaWan. 

## Toolchain
[PlatformIO](http://platformio.org "Cross-platform build system") is the ideal foundation when developing IoT devices. It supports cross-platform development for many different controller boards widely used in the maker field and also for industrial applications.

### Installation
#### Python 2.7

**Windows**

* download Python 2.7.x from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* install for all users
* select destinationdirectory (keep default): C:\Python27\
* add python.exe to path

**Linux**

Install Python 2.7 using your package manager.

#### PlatformIO
Install PlatformIO using the Python Package Manager
(see also http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#python-package-manager):

* in a cmd shell enter: `pip install -U platformio`
* upgrade pip, in the cmd shell enter: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* upgrade PlatformIO, in the cmd shell enter: `pio upgrade`


### How to build the project
    1. Create a directory where your Eclipse Workspace will be stored and where this project shall be cloned into. E.g. `C:\git\pio-prj`
    2. Clone the repository - [wiring-lora-skeleton](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/wiring-lora-skeleton) - into the folder you created before, `git clone git@github.com:ERNICommunity/wiring-lora-skeleton.git`
    3. Open a command shell in the just cloned project folder, i.e in `C:\git\pio-prj\wiring-lora-skeleton`
    4. Run the command `pio run`, this starts the project build 

### Open project in Eclipse CDT
    1. Run the command `pio init --ide eclipse`, this prepares the project to be edited using Eclipse CDT
    2. Open Eclipse CDT, choose the folder you created before as workspace, i.e `C:\git\pio-prj`
    3. Import the project with File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace, choose the `wiring-lora-skeleton` (i.e `C:\git\pio-prj\wiring-lora-skeleton`)

### Connect Terminal Emulation
In order to test and run the CLI commands, a terminal emulation program shall be used. The one giving you the best experience will be the [**HTerm**](http://www.der-hammer.info/terminal/). 

Load the _hterm-com10.cfg_ file to configure HTerm properly. Alter the COM10 accordingly to the one that has been selected on your computer.
Important setting in **HTERM** config for Status lines: ***DTR*** & ***RTS*** shall be set to true.
